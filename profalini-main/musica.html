    <h3>Greedy</h3>
    <pre>
    He said, "Are you serious? I've tried, but I can't figure out
    I've been next to you all night and still don't know what you're about
    You keep ta- (ta-ta-) talkin', but not much comin' out your mouth
    Can't you tell that I want you?" I say, yeah

    I would want myself
    Baby, please believe me
    I'll put you through hell
    Just to know me, yeah, yeah
    So sure of yourself
    Baby, don't get greedy
    That shit won't end well
    Ooh, end well
    ...

    <h3>Save your tears for another day</h3>
    <pre>
        Ooh
        Na-na, yeah
        I saw you dancing in a crowded room (uh)
        You look so happy when I'm not with you
        But then you saw me, caught you by surprise
        A single teardrop falling from your eye
        I don't know why I run away
        I make you cry when I run away
        You could've asked me why I broke your heart
        You could've told me that you fell apart
        But you walked past me like I wasn't there
        And just pretended like you didn't care
        I don't know why I run away
        I make you cry when I run away

        Take me back 'cause I wanna stay
        Save your tears for another
        Save your tears for another day
        Save your tears for another day (so)
        ...
